    " Predicting stock price movements has long been an issue for investors, and analysts alike. With the rise of data analysis and machine learning, the potential to leverage datasets has changed how predictions are approached. Public sentiment derived from social media platforms and news outlets has emerged as a crucial factor influencing market behavior, reflecting investor emotions and perceptions about companies. Additionally, Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) scores have gained prominence as indicators of a company's long-term viability, influencing investor decisions</a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) . Quarterly earnings reports remain at the forefront of financial analysis, providing insights into a company's performance and future outlook. This project seeks to investigate how these elements can be leveraged together to enhance the accuracy of predicting daily stock price movements for S&P 500 companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many different studies have explored the idea of public sentiment affecting stock price. For instance, emotion discourse relayed on the social media forum known as Twitter has been shown to affect the S&P 500 </a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) . The study showed that emotional outburst had a negative correlation with the S&P 500, possibly suggesting that public sentiment could be predictive of stock trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, ESG performance has been shown to have an impact on stock prices, companies with higher ESG scores generally experience better stock performance, especially in sectors where ethical considerations are of great importance.The findings indicate that ESG ratings can significantly influence investor behavior and market valuations, highlighting the need to integrate these scores into predictive models for a more comprehensive analysis </a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) .\n",

    "Our main hypothesis is that daily stock price movements for S&P 500 companies can be moderately predicted by combining public sentiment from social media and news, ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) scores, and quarterly earnings report data. We predict that while each factor contributes to the prediction accuracy, public sentiment will have the most immediate and significant impact on daily price movements, especially in sectors like technology and consumer goods. ESG scores might have a more gradual, long-term impact, while quarterly earnings will cause short-term volatility around earnings release dates, particularly in sectors like financials and industrials."

    "There are several ethical and privacy concerns associated with using public sentiment data, particularly from social media platforms. Social media data, especially from platforms like Twitter or Reddit, may include personally identifiable information (PII) or be subject to terms of use that limit how the data can be collected, stored, and analyzed. To avoid privacy violations, we would ensure that any data collection process adheres to platform-specific policies and anonymizes user data. Additionally, sentiment analysis tools should not extract or store user-specific information but should aggregate sentiment data at the company or market level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bias is another significant concern, particularly with public sentiment data. Social media users are not a fully representative sample of the population, and there may be inherent biases in who posts, which platforms are used, and which companies or sectors are discussed. For example, technology companies may be overrepresented in social media discussions compared to industrial or utilities companies. To mitigate this, we would compare sentiment data across multiple platforms and consider weighting sentiment scores by the volume of discussion relative to the sector’s overall market size.\n",
    "\n",
    "ESG data also presents potential biases, as ESG scoring methodologies vary between providers, and the criteria used to assess companies can reflect subjective judgments. To address this, we would consider using multiple ESG data sources and cross-referencing scores to minimize provider-specific biases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, when communicating the results of the analysis, we would need to be transparent about the limitations of the data, particularly the potential biases in social media sentiment and ESG scores. Additionally, we would avoid making deterministic claims about stock price movements, as stock markets are influenced by a multitude of factors beyond those in the dataset."
